This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# laneheroes-frontend
The Frontend for laneheroes (Backend)

# 🛡️ LaneHeroes Frontend (Admin)

**LaneHeroes** is a backend project built with **Java Spring Boot**, designed as a database system to store information about Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre games (examples: Mobile Legends Bang Bang, Dota 2, League of Legends). It serves as the backend API for managing cross-franchise game data such as heroes, games, platforms and companies.

This is the Frontend part of **LaneHeroes**, where the data stored and processed in the backend will be displayed. However, this frontend part is to provide a UI/UX for site admins and developers to manage the data within. This is not yet about what the public will see.

This project is meant as a **proof of frontend engineering skill**, focusing on:
- Responsive UI using React and TailwindCSS
- Modular component design
- Dynamic form handling and validation
- RESTful API integration with Axios
- Simple Login/Logout system
- Smooth user experience with optimistic UI and feedback (Toast, Modal, etc.)

----

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** – for type-safe development
- **React.js (with Next.js)** – frontend framework with server-side rendering capabilities
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first responsive styling
- **Axios** – for HTTP requests to backend APIs
- **React-Hot-Toast** – for instant feedback and notifications

----

## Features

- **Modular CRUD Interface** - Add, update, and delete entities like Hero, Game, Company, Platform, Callsign, and User with dynamic UI components.
- **Unified Modal System** - Centralized modals for both Add and Edit operations, adapting dynamically based on selected entity.
- **Batch Upload Handling** - File upload UI integrated with backend for Excel-based data population.
- **Input Validation** - Built-in checks for required fields, including proper email format and enum-safe role selection.
- **Responsive Layouts** - Cards and containers automatically adapt to screen size for clean display on both desktop and mobile.
- **Toast Notifications** - Real-time success and error feedback using react-hot-toast.
- **Environment-Based API Configuration** - Switch API base URLs using .env setup via NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL.
- **Image Previews** - Game and hero icons rendered through next/image for performance optimization.

----

## Future Improvements

- **Theme and UI Enhancements** - Improve visual polish with a design system (e.g., Tailwind components, dark mode support, animations via Framer Motion).
- **Frontend Unit & Integration Tests** - Include Unit Testing
- **Form Validation Library** - Use react-hook-form for more scalable and declarative form validation.
- **Caching & Performance Optimization** - Optimize API interactions by caching GET requests
- **Internationalization (i18n)** - Prepare UI for multi-language support.
- **Public Frontend** - Prepare the frontend that will be displayed for public, non-developer audience.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js (v18+ recommended. Made with v22.11.0)

- npm

- TypeScript (pre-configured in project)

- React.js with Next.js

- Installed modules/libraries (automatically installed via npm install):

- - axios — for API requests

- - react-hot-toast — for notifications

- - @tailwindcss — for styling

- Modern Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare the backend server**

Go here for more details: https://github.com/KristianW1234/laneheroes/ And make sure they're running.

2. **Clone the repository**

``bash
   git clone https://github.com/KristianW1234/laneheroes-frontend.git
   cd laneheroes-backend

3. **Install the dependencies**

Run this to install all within the package.json:

``bash
   npm install

4. **Setup local environment**

Create a file called .env.local within the src folder, then add the location of the backend server. For example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/laneHeroes
```

5. **Run the Development Server**

``bash
   npm run dev

The server will run in http://localhost:3000
